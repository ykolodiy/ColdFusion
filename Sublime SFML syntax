Installation
Via Package Control
First ensure Package Control is installed. More recent versions of Sublime Text 3 include a menu option and command palette entry for installing Package Control. You can also follow the instructions at https://packagecontrol.io/installation to install it.

Open the command palette (CTRL+SHIFT+P on Windows, CMD+SHIFT+P on a Mac) and select Package Control: Install Package.

Wait for the list to open and find the CFML entry (subtitled with this github repo github.com/jcberquist/sublimetext-cfml), then select it to install.

Restart Sublime Text 3.

Package Control will keep the CFML package up to date automatically for you.

Manual Installation
First locate your Sublime Text 3 packages directory. This can be easily done by opening the command palette in Sublime Text (CTRL+SHIFT+P on Windows, CMD+SHIFT+P on a Mac), and running Preferences: Browse Packages.

On Windows it will typically be something like this:

C:\Users\Username\AppData\Roaming\Sublime Text 3\Packages\
On a Mac it will be something like this

/Users/Username/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages/
Via Git

Open Terminal or Command Prompt and cd into your packages directory, then run:

git clone https://github.com/jcberquist/sublimetext-cfml.git ./CFML
Restart Sublime Text 3.

As changes are made to this repository and the package is updated, simply run the following command inside the folder where you installed the package in order to get your copy of the package up to date:

git pull origin master
Via ZIP Download

Use the Download ZIP option to download a zip of the repository to your computer. (The master branch zip file is located at https://github.com/jcberquist/sublimetext-cfml/archive/master.zip) Unzip this, and copy the the contents of the resulting repository folder into a subdirectory named CFML in your Sublime Text packages directory.

Restart Sublime Text 3.

As changes are made to this repository and the package is updated you will need to repeat this process (replacing the old contents in the CFML subdirectory) in order to get your copy of the package up to date.
